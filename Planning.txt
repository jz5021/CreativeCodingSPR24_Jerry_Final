So as of right now I've chosen to go forward with my first idea: ID.
I will change some parts of the project in order to make it take full advantage of p5's full capabilities.

Here's my reasoning for my choice as well as the changes I will be making:

- I found faults in my first project because it doesn't take full advantage of p5's capabilities in terms of user interaction.
  Why would I make an animation when I could make this so much easier as well as BETTER in a different program dedicated to animation.
  P5's uniquess in my eyes comes from the user interaction part of the program so an animation doesn't utilize this.

- My second idea, which has a real potential for this interactive capability doesn't actually come across as something that will be useful to me in the future.
  Although it's a cool idea with a lot of meat in terms of meaning, I just don't see how it benefits me other than showcasing my ability to use p5.js.
  The idea of having a clickable interaction could be fulfilled through my first idea.

- My third idea has a lot of potential as well; however, this requires a lot of deep understanding and experimentation for a single image.
  From my understanding of algorithmic processes for generative art, the code you write for one image basically only makes one image look good.
  As such, there are far better programs that can make these images in a more efficient manner as well.

- So now for my choice and the changes I will be making to it.
  I still want to stick with the idea of my identity as a multimedia artist and the different roles I play.
  Instead of making it so that you click on the character to change the background, I want to take inspiration from choosing classes in a game (warrior, mage, etc.)
  I want to communicate my background as someone who enjoys video games, and I think the most impactful franchise I have sunk thousands of hours into is Pokemon.
  As such, I want to create a sort of fusion between a class selection screen (which invites user interaction) combined with the visuals of a Pokemon game.
  I understand that this is a coding class, so I will create a wireframe using shapes in order to communicate the idea, and I will "skin" the game as much as possible as well
  because this is a crucial part of the project.
  My inspiration will largely come from the sprites created in generation 5 of the games: https://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Generation_V_Trainer_sprites
  These are unforunately, 80 x 80 pixel art images, which is a heavy load, so I can't guarantee the quality of the sprites as well as my backgrounds.


  Update 05/01/2024
  - I decided that working on this idea was a bit unfuilfilling to me, and I have decided to switch over to my second proposal because it somehow just feels more right to me
  - I haven't had much time to work on the code because I've had to work over the weekend this past week as well as just finish up final projects that are due earlier than this final project.
  - I have been primarily thinking about the progression of my scene and planning it out properly, but I feel like this might also be me coping with the fact that I'm not getting anything down on paper yet.
  - As for right now, I'll be working on a lo-fi wireframe vesion of my piece not necessarily utilizing all of the finished renderings of models
